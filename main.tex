\section{Introduction}
An MDP agent is defined as policy $\pi$ mapping states to actions.

There are numerous ways methods as to how a policy should be constructed, be it
through classical RL methods such as Policy Iteration or via an abstract
learning of state features and weights as is the case in Deep RL.

Either way, the outcome must be the same, such that a mapping between states and actions is
obtained
